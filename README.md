# Baye's Theorem applied to the Shipwrecked Sailors problem.

	## Project Purpose and Attribution: 

		My goal for this project is to read the book "Real World Python" by Lee Vaughn.
		First, I copy his code, parsing the meaning myself as I go, and then read his explanation.
		I also end up writing little tests throughout the code to make sure that the given code does what it is supposed to.
		This co-writing of code is giving me exposure to how Vaughn uses the imported libraries, native Python packags, etc.  
		More importantly, I get to study Vaughn's application of the Baye's Theorem to a gamified-real problem.  

	## Virtual Environment Set Up

		Python virtual environment created via venv. 
		Virtual environment named *lostSailor_env*.

		Virtual Environment start up (you always forget): source lostSailor_env/bin/activate
		Virt env shutdown: deactivate

		Packages installed in environment:
			numpy
			scipy
			matplotlib
			ipython
			jupyter
			pandas
			sympy
			nose
			opencv-contrib-python
